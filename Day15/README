## solution

It's a path finding question, indeed.
From the start position to end position, and you have many roads, each roads have different length(in this question risk level).
There are some solution in path finding question.
In this project, I choose BFS.
The general idea is that:

1. find all the neighborhood unreached points
2. get the nearest neighborhood points(P) to the start point, so that's the min distance between strat point and P
3. after get P, update neighborhood points
4. when you get end point, that's the answer

There are some other methods like A-star, Dijkstra and so on.
